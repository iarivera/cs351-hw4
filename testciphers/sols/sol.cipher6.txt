THEN SOMETHING JUST SNAPPED, SOMETHING INSIDE OF ME. “NO! NO MORE! THAT’S IT! I DON’T CARE!” I DIDN’T CARE ANYMORE. I DIDN’T CARE ABOUT BEING BETTER THAN KAKAROTT. I DIDN’T CARE ABOUT BEING A SUPER SAIYAN. I DIDN’T CARE IF I LIVED! I DIDN’T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING AND THEN IT HAPPENED. YES, THAT’S HOW IT HAPPENED. THAT’S HOW I BECAME A SUPER SAIYAN. THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED. I AM THE PRINCE OF ALL SAIYANS ONCE AGAIN!
