MY BRO IS DEAD. HE'S GONE. BUT HE'S RIGHT THERE ON MY BACK AND HERE IN MY HEART. HE LIVES ON AS A PART OF ME! IF YOU'RE GONNA DIG, DIG TO THE HEAVENS. NO MATTER WHAT'S IN MY WAY, I WON'T STOP. ONCE I'VE DUG THROUGH, IT MEANS THAT I'VE WON! JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM? I'M SIMON. I'M NOT MY BRO. I'M ME! SIMON THE DIGGER!!
