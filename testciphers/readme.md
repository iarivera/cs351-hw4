## testciphers
In this directory multiple test files are created that contain the strings of text for the program to automatically decipher.

The solutions are in `sols`, with the substitution cipiher at the bottom of the solution.

To create a new test cipher:
- find a long string of text
- paste the string of text into the beginning of the solution cipher `sol.cipher_.txt`
- capitalize the text and replace any numeric characters
- paste this modified string of text into [this cipher generator](https://cryptii.com/pipes/alphabetical-substitution) with the 'ciphertext alphabet' being the string at the bottom of the file
- copy and paste the output into the matching numbered `cipher_.txt`
